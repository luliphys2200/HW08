# Homework 08 for phys2200

These are the graphs for the horizontal distance that a glider travels when the initial velocity, launch angle,
and initial altitude are changed. The initial velocity ranges from 0.5 to 5, the launch angle ranges from -pi/3
to pi/3, and the initial altitude ranges from 0.1 to 5.
